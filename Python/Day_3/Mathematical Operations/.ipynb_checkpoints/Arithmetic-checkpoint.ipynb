    "# How can you change this code so that instead of getting 7, we get 3?\n",
    "# How can you change this line of code given what you know about PEMDASLR?\n",
    "# Alright, so this will involve a little bit of trial and error.\n",
    "# And the most important tool we have access to is the parentheses or the brackets. \n",
    "# This means that we can actually isolate bits of our code, which normally have very low priority and turn them into higher priority operations.\n",
    "# So in this case, we know that 3 * 3 is going to happen first, and then the multiplication, and then the addition on the left, and then the subtraction.\n",
    "# But if we added a set of parentheses around our 3 + 3, then out of all of these calculations, this particular one suddenly becomes the highest priority and it will happen first.\n",
    "# So if I change what I've got in Thonny to our new version and go ahead and debug through it,\n",
    "# the very first calculation it's going to perform is this 3 + 3 inside the brackets and we end up with 6.\n",
    "# So then it's going to go again from left to right, prioritizing multiplication and division.\n",
    "# So then it's 3 * 6 is 18. 18 / 3 is 6. 6 - 3 is 3..\n",
